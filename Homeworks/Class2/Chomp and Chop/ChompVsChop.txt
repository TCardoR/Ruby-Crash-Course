Both "Chomp" and "Chop" methods have the same purpose, but they have a litle difference. When we talk about
the Chomp method, its basic purpose is to knock off some specific characters from the string we are working with. On the
other hand, the Chop method will do the same but always with the last character of the string, no matter what it iss.
